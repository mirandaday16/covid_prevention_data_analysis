Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/roche-data-science-coalition/uncover

Note: two datafiles are too big to be put in the github, these are the following:

USAFacts/confirmed-covid-19-cases-in-us-by-state-and-county.csv

USAFacts/confirmed-covid-19-deaths-in-us-by-state-and-county.csv

The CSV file and charts on this site show a relative volume of directions requests per country/region, sub-region or city compared to a baseline volume on January 13th, 2020. We define our day as midnight-to-midnight, Pacific time. Cities are defined as the greater metropolitan area and their geographic boundaries remain constant across the data set. In many countries/regions, sub-regions, and cities, relative volume has increased since January 13th, consistent with normal, seasonal usage of Apple Maps. Day of week effects are important to normalize as you use this data. Data that is sent from users’ devices to the Maps service is associated with random, rotating identifiers so Apple doesn’t have a profile of individual movements and searches. Apple Maps has no demographic information about our users, so we can’t make any statements about the representativeness of usage against the overall population.

These datasets show how visits and length of stay at different places change compared to a baseline. We calculate these changes using the same kind of aggregated and anonymized data used to show popular times for places in Google Maps.

Changes for each day are compared to a baseline value for that day of the week:

The baseline is the median value, for the corresponding day of the week, during the 5-week period Jan 3–Feb 6, 2020.
The datasets show trends over several months with the most recent data representing approximately 2-3 days ago—this is how long it takes to produce the datasets.
What data is included in the calculation depends on user settings, connectivity, and whether it meets our privacy threshold. When the data doesn't meet quality and privacy thresholds, you might see empty fields for certain places and dates.

We include categories that are useful to social distancing efforts as well as access to essential services.

We calculate these insights based on data from users who have opted-in to Location History for their Google Account, so the data represents a sample of our users. As with all samples, this may or may not represent the exact behavior of a wider population.
