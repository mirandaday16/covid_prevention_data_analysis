Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/roche-data-science-coalition/uncover

Note: two datafiles are too big to be put in the github, these are the following:

USAFacts/confirmed-covid-19-cases-in-us-by-state-and-county.csv

USAFacts/confirmed-covid-19-deaths-in-us-by-state-and-county.csv

Details on Apple Mobility Data:

The CSV file and charts on this site show a relative volume of directions requests per country/region, sub-region or city compared to a baseline volume on January 13th, 2020. We define our day as midnight-to-midnight, Pacific time. Cities are defined as the greater metropolitan area and their geographic boundaries remain constant across the data set. In many countries/regions, sub-regions, and cities, relative volume has increased since January 13th, consistent with normal, seasonal usage of Apple Maps. Day of week effects are important to normalize as you use this data. Data that is sent from users’ devices to the Maps service is associated with random, rotating identifiers so Apple doesn’t have a profile of individual movements and searches. Apple Maps has no demographic information about our users, so we can’t make any statements about the representativeness of usage against the overall population.
